# Test Video Rendering

The video rendering seems successful based on logs, but the component is showing "No video data provided".

Let me analyze the issue:

1. Entry point: ✅ Using `src/index.ts`
2. Composition ID: ✅ Using `VideoComposition`
3. Data structure: ✅ Has 7 segments with mediaUrls
4. Captions: ✅ Has 7 captions with proper timing
5. Rendering: ✅ Video file is generated successfully

The issue must be in the component validation logic.
